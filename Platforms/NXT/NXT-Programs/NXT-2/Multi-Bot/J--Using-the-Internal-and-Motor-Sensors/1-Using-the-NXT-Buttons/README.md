# [Using the NXT Buttons](http://www.nxtprograms.com/NXT2/multi-bot/internal.html#Buttons)

> The three buttons on the face of the NXT Brick (Left Arrow, Right Arrow, Orange Enter button) are accessible as sensors from a program and act almost exactly like Touch Sensors.  See the Single Touch Sensor section for ideas on basic use of these sensors.  One important difference between the NXT Buttons and Touch Sensors, however, is that the NXT cannot detect multiple NXT buttons being pressed at the same time, so strategies involving simultaneous presses, such as those used in the double-touch sensor remote controls, will not work with NXT buttons.  Also note that the fourth NXT button (dark gray Back/Abort button) is not accessible from NXT-G programs, as pressing this button will always abort the program.
