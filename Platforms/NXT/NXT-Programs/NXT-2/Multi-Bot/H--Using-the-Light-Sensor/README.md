# [(H) Using the Light Sensor](http://www.nxtprograms.com/NXT2/multi-bot/light.html)

> The programs in this section give examples of using the Multi-Bot's Line Sensor with the Color Sensor replaced by the standard Light Sensor, which is included in the LEGO Education NXT set (9797) and the original version of the Retail NXT set (8527). 

> Note: The Light Sensor programs require that you replace the Color Sensor in the Line Sensor building instructions with the Light Sensor. For programs using the Color Sensor, see Using the Color Sensor.
