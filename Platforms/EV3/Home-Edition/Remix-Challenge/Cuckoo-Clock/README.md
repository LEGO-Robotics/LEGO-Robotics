# Cuckoo Clock

> The LEGO MINDSTORMS Cuckoo Clock is a working cuckoo and alarm clock. It tells the time. It has a cuckoo bird that jumps out to ‘cuckoo’ every 15 minutes. And it has an alarm function that triggers a moving, shooting vehicle to get you out of bed. The LEGO MINDSTORMS Cuckoo Clock is a remix of the EV3 (31313) and LEGO Technic Heavy Lift Helicopter (42052) sets.
