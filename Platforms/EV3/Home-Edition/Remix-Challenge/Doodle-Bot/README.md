# DoodleBot

> Use the LEGO® MINDSTORMS® DOODLEBOT to draw your own artistic doodles – or set it in self-portrait mode for a drawing of itself, by itself. Place paper under the robot, position a pen in its arms, and use the EV3 remote to draw your own fanciful works of art. The robot comes preprogrammed with three different drawing modes.

> The DOODLEBOT is the winner of the 2017 LEGO MINDSTORMS Remix Challenge and was built with a mix of elements from the popular LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 (31313) and LEGO Technic Extreme Adventure (42069) sets.
