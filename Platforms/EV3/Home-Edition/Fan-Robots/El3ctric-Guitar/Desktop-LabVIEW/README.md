# El3ctric-Guitar

A musical instrument made out of LEGO Bricks!

This is an electric guitar made out of LEGO MINDSTORMS!
Even if you can't play a real guitar, you will be able to rock with this one!
Just put your finger in the slider, and glide along the neck.
With the other hand, struck the axle to play notes.
The notes belong to the pentatonic E scale.

Have fun! 
EV3 ROCKS!
