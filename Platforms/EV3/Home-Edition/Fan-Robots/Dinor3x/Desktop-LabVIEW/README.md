# Dinor3x

A life-like walking dinosaur!

DINOR3X is a robotic triceratops dinosaur capable of walking and turning on its four legs. Using the IR-Senor it detects obstacles within its proximity which enables it to avoid walking into them. The walking mechanism is based on the Theo Jansen mechanism, which is a very clever leg mechanism that gives a very life like walking motion. The Theo Jansen mechanism is modified on the robot to be driven by two motors which makes is able to turn as well as walk in a straight line.

I've always been fascinated with walking mechanisms, and in general clever mechanics that lets you lower the amount of motors needed in a robot. The easy solution for a robot is always to have one motor for each joint, and if you should have that for the mechanism on DINOR3X, it would take eight motors to control the legs. I hope this walking mechanism will appeal to some of the you more advanced builders.

DINOR3X uses all three motors from the set along with the IR-Sensor and the Touch Sensor. The two large motors are used for the walking mechanism, and the medium motor makes the mouth open and close. The IR Sensor lets DINOR3X detect obstacles in its proximity so it avoids walking into them, and the touch sensor is used to calibrate the walking mechanism so that the legs gets aligned perfectly so that DINOR3X can both walk and turn.

Hope you enjoy this model!
