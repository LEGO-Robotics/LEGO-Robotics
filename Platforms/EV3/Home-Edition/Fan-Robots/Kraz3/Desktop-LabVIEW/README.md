<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><ActivityCopyPaste fontsize="12" fontfamily="Verdana" xmlns="http://www.ni.com/ActivityRichTextDocument.xsd"><p>The first program we are going to write for KRAZ3 is the <font color="#337CBB"><u><a action="GoToProgram:KRAZ3_01_BASIC RC.ev3p">Basic Remote Control</a></u></font>  </p><p /><p>The reason we cannot use the built in IR Remote feature is because of how the large motors in this model are used upside down. So the solution was to program our own remote behavior.</p><p> </p><p>Of course now you can use this program for any tank-like robot you make that have the motor place upside down (or you would need to invert the sign of the motor power value.) </p><p /><p>If you want KRAZ3 to drive super fast just change the motor power from 75% to 100% in those green blocks.</p><p /><p>Make sure the remote is set to channel 1, plug in the EV3 into your computer and press the green triangle Play icon to start using this program. </p><p /><p>Go ahead, download and run this program now.</p><p /><p>When you are ready, lets investigate the <font color="#337CBB"><u><a action="NavigateActivity-GoToNextSlide">Next Program</a></u></font> where we will add reation to the touch sensor!</p></ActivityCopyPaste>

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><ActivityCopyPaste fontsize="12" fontfamily="Verdana" xmlns="http://www.ni.com/ActivityRichTextDocument.xsd"><p>In this program we explore the use of the touch sensor and an extra button on the remote.</p><p /><p>Try this program and see what happens when your or someone else touches the sensor. Thats right he does a crazy kung-fu move!!!</p><p /><p>Now try pressing the big button on the remote he should wiggle his head.</p><p /><p>I hope these examples make you realize you could program KRAZ3 to do or say whatever you want!?</p><p /><p /><p /><p>Now lets play with the color sensor in our <font color="#337CBB"><u><a action="NavigateActivity-GoToNextSlide">next program</a></u></font> </p></ActivityCopyPaste>

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><ActivityCopyPaste fontsize="12" fontfamily="Verdana" xmlns="http://www.ni.com/ActivityRichTextDocument.xsd"><p>Now lay the Mission Pad flat on the ground and place KRAZ3 on it, now you can try driving the robot over the different color spots and see its reactions.</p><p /><p>Ride over the red line find out what makes him tick :)</p><p /><p>Try driving over different colors, sometimes you might need to back up to aim the light sensor.</p><p /><p>Have fun exploring and modifying teh program to make it say different things on different colors. </p><p /><p /><p /><p>Now... Imagine if KRAZ3 would simply follow you! </p><p>Click on the big button to check out the next program.</p></ActivityCopyPaste>

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><ActivityCopyPaste fontsize="12" fontfamily="Verdana" xmlns="http://www.ni.com/ActivityRichTextDocument.xsd"><p>We will now use the remote in a completely different way.</p><p>It will now be used as a beacon that KRAZ3 will be able to find and follow!</p><p /><p>Download and run this program then press the large botton on the remote so that the green LED stays on. The remote is now in beacon mode and KRAZ3 should start following it.</p><p> </p><p /><p /><p>This progarm was inspired by the "follow me" program built by NeXTSTORM for use in his Ev3D4 model project. You should check it out next if you havn&amp;#39;t already.  </p></ActivityCopyPaste>
