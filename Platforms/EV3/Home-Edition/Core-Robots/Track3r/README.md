# Track3r

> If you have never built a LEGO MINDSTORMS robot before, we recommend you start by building this one! TRACK3R is a crawler-mounted, all-terrain robot with four interchangeable tools. Start by building the body of the robot, then discover the possibilities of the four different TRACK3R tools: the bi-blade blender, the blasting bazooka, the gripping claw, and the hammer.
>
> Control TRACK3R with your smart phone or tablet with the free robot commander app.
