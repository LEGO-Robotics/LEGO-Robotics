## [Getting Started](https://mythinkscape.com/labs/v2/173264)


### 1. Introduction


#### 1.1. Welcome to Explore


__Introduction to FIRST® LEGO® League Explore__

In FIRST® LEGO® League Explore, teams focus on the fundamentals of engineering as they explore real world problems, learn to design and code, and create unique solutions made with LEGO bricks and powered by LEGO Education WeDo 2.0. FIRST LEGO League Explore is one of three divisions by age group of the FIRST LEGO League program. This program inspires young people to experiment and grow their confidence, critical thinking, and design skills through hands-on STEM learning. FIRST LEGO League was created through an alliance between FIRST® and LEGO® Education.


__Before Starting__

Allow several weeks from the time of purchase until all the product ordered arrives and has been distributed and set up (software downloaded onto electronic devices, devices connected to the internet) before officially starting the program. 

The actual season will open in August, and that is when the Explore set and guidebooks will ship to you. You will find the season materials [here](https://www.firstlegoleague.org/season).


__Working Together__

During each session, the children will experience the engineering design process. There is no set order for this process, and they may go through each part several times in a single session. This means that children will be exploring the theme and ideas during a session, creating solutions, testing them, iterating and changing them, and then sharing what they’ve learned with others.

Children work together in teams of six using pieces from the LEGO® Education WeDo 2.0 set and an Explore set. They will collaborate and communicate to build, learn, and play together. Children should be encouraged in every session to work with their teammates, listen to each other, take turns, and share ideas and pieces.

- Coding team model
- Showcasing at festival
- Building team model
- Working as a team

#### 1.2. Getting Started Checklist

__Getting Started Checklist__

Use this checkpoint to help you get started and guide you toward success. Many of these items are explored within the other sections of this course. 

- Ensure you have received all materials needed to implement FIRST® LEGO® League Explore.

- Read the student Engineering Notebook and the Team Meeting Guide before starting the sessions. They are full of very useful information to guide you through the sessions.

- Identify the space where you will complete the sessions and store materials between the sessions. Or a place to keep assembled builds between sessions if desired.

- Think about the final celebration event. Will you have it in your classroom and invite the children’s families? Or will you have your registered team attend a festival led by your local partner?

- Create a plan. How often during the week will you do it? Will you complete a whole session at once or split the tasks across different times?

- Unpack the WeDo 2.0 set (if not already done) and sort the LEGO® elements into the tray before starting Session 1. 

- Get your children familiar with WeDo 2.0. The children could complete the Introduction and some Getting Started activities in the app so that they gain experience in building and coding before starting the sessions.

- Make sure you have a Bluetooth-enabled device with the WeDo 2.0 app installed.

- Make sure the hub is fully charged or has batteries in it.

- Encourage family and home engagement. 

- Familiarize yourself with the contents of the Explore set.

- Explore the FIRST® Core Values. These are the essential foundation for your team.

- Watch the FIRST LEGO League Explore Season video and other videos on the [FIRST LEGO League YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuGaG4GtEj82i3pByi_bM3A).

- Discuss vocabulary related to the season theme with the children.


#### 1.3. Explore Materials

Look over the following list for what materials and space you will need in your classroom or meeting space. It is recommended that students work in teams of four if implementing in a classroom. Each team will need space to design, build, and code with their WeDo 2.0 set as well as to participate in teamwork activities. Access to an electronic device is important for each team to have for a successful program implementation. 

For each student:
- 1 Engineering Notebook

For each team:
- LEGO Education WeDo2.0 Set
- 1 Explore Set
- 1 electronic device (see Team Meeting Guide for specific details)
- Team poster board and art supplies

Classroom or Meeting Space:
- Small workstations/tables for each team (enough space for LEGO building, electronic device, and assembled models)
- Portable or permanent storage
- Internet access (optional)
- Electrical support

Team materials:
- Explore Set
- Prototyping Pieces
- Explore Model
- Explore Mat
- Building Instructions
- Engineering Notebook

#### 1.4. General Management Tips

__FACILITATOR TIPS__: Role of Facilitator:

- Determine your timeline. How often will you meet and for how long? How many meetings will you have before your festival?

- Set team guidelines, procedures, and behaviors for your meetings.

- Get into the mindset that the team should be doing most of the work and learning. You are there to facilitate their journey and remove any major obstacles.
Lead your team through the Introduction and Share activities provided in each session.

- Use the guiding questions in the sessions to provide focus and direction on what the team will do.

- Read the Engineering Notebook carefully. Each team member should have one. The Engineering Notebook contains all the information the team needs, and it guides them through the sessions.

- The tips in this Team Meeting Guide will direct you how to support each session. As facilitator, help guide the team members in the performance of their roles during each session.

- The sessions contain individual and team tasks to help the team perform their roles independently.

#### 1.6. Playful Learning in Action

The FIRST® Core Values are the cornerstones of the program. They are among the fundamental elements of FIRST® LEGO® League. By embracing the Core Values, children use discovery and exploration of the theme in each session and learn that helping one another is the foundation of teamwork. It is important that the children have fun. The more playful the sessions are, the more motivated the children will be.

Core Values:
- __Teamwork__: We found we were stronger when we worked together
- __Inclusion__: We respected each other and embraced our differences
- __Innovation__: We used creative and persistence to solve problems
- __Fun__: We enjoyed and celebrated what we did!
- __Discovery__: We explored new skills and ideas
- __Impact__: We applied what we learned to improve our world

### 2. Best Practices


#### 2.1. Storage and Material Management

Before you get started with the FIRST® LEGO® League Explore program content, you might want to play a game where the teams identify pieces in their WeDo 2.0 sets. It is recommended that students organize their LEGO® sets to help in taking ownership of materials. This would allow you to start processes and procedures for keeping the sets organized. 

After you have gathered or purchased all of the materials your students will need, you could use plastic storage tubs or other containers to create a kit for each team in your class. You could store the Engineering Notebooks and WeDo 2.0 sets inside the kit for each team, ensuring that each team is responsible for their materials and they won’t get mixed up with others in the classroom.

Alternatively, you could also assign and label each WeDo 2.0 set and Explore set with the team name and/or number, so the students know what materials to grab each time. Be sure to check the battery levels of your hardware devices and charge them as needed between sessions. You will need batteries for the Smarthubs for each of the WeDo 2.0 sets also. 

After you have all the kits assembled, you will need a place to store them. In Session 8, each team may need a sturdy board or container (such as a large plastic container, a cardboard box, a wooden board, etc.) to protect, store, and potentially transport their team models. Beginning with Session 10, each team will need a poster board to create a team poster. You will also need to identify a place to store the posters.


__Material Management Tips__

- Place any extra or found LEGO pieces in a cup. Have the children who are missing pieces come to the cup to look for them.

- Wait to dismiss your team until you look over their LEGO set.

- The lid of the LEGO set can be used as a tray to keep pieces from rolling away.

- Use plastic bags or containers to store any unfinished builds and their associated pieces or assembled models.

- Designate a storage space for the built models, Explore set, and LEGO container.

- The role of the Material Manager is to help in the process of clearing away and storing materials.


#### 2.2. Managing Student Teams


__Facilitator Role__: Explore teacher:

The facilitator's role should include developing holistic skills, building STEM confidence, embracing challenging activities, and using play, discovery, and exploration.

Important things to consider when using the facilitator mindset is to:

- Reinforce FIRST Core Values and habits of learning.

- Ask open-ended questions that make students reflect on their thinking; guiding questions.

- Be comfortable with not having all the answers.

- Let students learn for themselves through problem-solving.

- Create opportunities for students to have ownership of the learning process and outcomes.

- Reflect on student and team goals and how they are working to achieve them.
Guide students to the resources to help them achieve their goals.

- Celebrate mistakes and see learning opportunities.


__Student Growth Mindset__: Student growth:

As you guide students through their experience, having the right mindset is important. Creating student ownership of learning can assist with this. Ownership can be achieved by allowing students to focus on the skills they are developing and what they want to achieve and to use their problem-solving skills.
There are no right or wrong solutions, just different ways of solving problems. There is plenty of opportunities for students to enjoy their successes and learn from their mistakes.

As a facilitator, if you can establish perseverance and resilience as traits to celebrate and be grateful for, students will be more likely to strive for them. Students need to be challenged just enough that it stretches their minds and creativity without overwhelming them.


#### 2.3. Implementation


__Flexible Implementation__

First and foremost, use your professional judgment to augment this program to meet the needs of your students, class or meeting space, class timing and additional curricular requirements. Set student expectations for participation in the program based on the student growth mindset of holistic and STEM skills.


__Teaming as Designed__

The sessions in the guidebooks have guided tasks for teams of students to complete.

Here are the reasons behind this design:

- Ensures equitable experience for every student in all aspects of the program.

- Additional opportunity for collaboration and communication.

- Small groups promote deeper learning of content and build holistic skills to share out learning with other team members.

- Having smaller groups allows for students to get hands-on time with building, coding, and exploration.


__How to Run Differentiated Groups__

- Physically split space to facilitate working in small groups (teams).

- Establish norms for movement and talking in small groups.

- Be comfortable with talking and movement within groups.

- Orient students to daily goals for learning using the student outcomes for each session listed in the Team Meeting Guide.

- Have individual check-ins with each team at the start of class.

- Determine the length of time for daily tasks ahead of class and share with students.

- End each class with whole group sharing using the guiding questions outlined in the Team Meeting Guide as inspiration.


__Implementation Timing__

You will need to adjust how each session is completed by your students if your designated class time to complete each session is different than the allotted 60 minutes per session outlined in the guides. The length this program will take to complete will depend on time within the day you have available to do FIRST® LEGO® League and how often you will teach this program (daily, weekly, etc.).

Following is a daily lesson planning example for how to adjust the session content to meet a different class time frame. This example is from Session 1 and uses a 30-minute class time.


#### 2.4. Team Roles

Here are sample team roles to use during the sessions. Everyone on the team could experience each role multiple times throughout their FIRST® LEGO® League Explore experience. Using roles helps the team function more efficiently and ensures that everyone on the team is engaged. Multiple children will fill some roles during a session. For example, the builder and coder roles can be duplicated where the experience is designed for a pair of children.

- __Facilitator__: Guides the team through the session and their learning to achieve session outcomes.

- __Journey Recorder__: Captures the team's journey by taking pictures or video. This media can be used for the team poster.

- __Team Captain__: Shares team progress with Facilitator. Ensures session tasks are completed.

- __LEGO Element Finder__: Locates the specific LEGO elements needed for each build step.

- __Material Manager__: Gathers materials needed for the session and returns materials at end of session.

- __Builder__: Assembles the LEGO builds following the building instructions.

- __Coder__: Operates the device and creates the programs in the app.
