# Imperfect Maze Map

Imperfect mazes may have loops and isolated wall segments. This may make it slightly easier for a human to solve, but can also make it harder for a computer.

When generating an imperfect maze, the columns and rows must always be an odd number. It's also preferable to generate a large maze. Your robot will start at the center of the maze.
