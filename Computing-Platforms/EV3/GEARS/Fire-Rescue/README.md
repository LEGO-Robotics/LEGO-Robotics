# Fire Rescue

Rescue the victims from the fire!

Red victims are worth 10 points, but must be rescued fast! Green victims are worth 5 points, and can be rescued as long as you have time left. Both victims can be picked up using the robot's magnet.

Your time starts when the center of your robot moves out of the starting area.
