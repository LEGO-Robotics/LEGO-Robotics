# Find the Target

There is a single randomly placed target. Program your robot to automatically find and hit the target.

Your robot may turn around, but should otherwise stay at the starting position. Solving this requires a combination of what you have done for the "Variable Range" challenge and the Gyro world's "Random Direction" challenge.
