# High and Low

There are a total of 4 targets. All of them are 200cm away from your starting position, and are spaced 50cm apart vertically.

Program your robot to hit all of them.

Advanced: Create a function that takes a distance and height as inputs, and launch the paintball at the correct angle and power to hit the target.
