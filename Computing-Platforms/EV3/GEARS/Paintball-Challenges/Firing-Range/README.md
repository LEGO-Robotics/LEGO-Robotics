# Firing Range

Test out the paintball launcher here.

Experiment 1
- Raise the paintball launcher to a 45 degrees angle.
- Launch the paintball at different power and record how far it travelled.
- Plot your recordings on a chart.
- Basic: Keep your chart and use it in the later challenges.
- Advanced: Can you find a mathematical equation to describe the curve in your chart?
- Advanced: Create a function that takes a distance as an input, and launch the paintball to that distance by controlling power.

Experiment 2
- Launch the paintball at full power, but vary the launcher angle from 0 to 90 degrees.
- Record down the distance travelled for each launch angle and plot it on a chart.
- Basic: Keep your chart and use it in the later challenges.
- Advanced: Can you find a mathematical equation to describe the curve in your chart?
- Advanced: Create a function that takes a distance as an input, and launch the paintball to that distance by controlling launch angle.
