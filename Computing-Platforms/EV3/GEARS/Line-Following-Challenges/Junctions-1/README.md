# Junctions 1

Handling junctions.

Junctions are not difficult to handle, but can be tedious to program for unless you have prepared suitable functions.

Task 1: Pick a random point (eg. "D") and program your robot to go there and stop.

Task 2: Pick a series of random points (eg. "C, L, A, Q, J,") and program your robot to go to each end point in turn. Beep at each point and stop at the last.

You'll need a double sensor line follower robot for this world.
