# [(G) Using the Color Sensor](http://www.nxtprograms.com/NXT2/multi-bot/color.html)

> The programs in this section show different ways to use Multi-Bot's Line Sensor and Ball Trap Sensor attachments, which both use the NXT 2.0 Color Sensor. 

> Note: The Color Sensor programs require the NXT 2.0 Color Sensor and the software that comes with the NXT 2.0 Retail kit (8547) or the LEGO Education NXT-G 2.1 software. These programs cannot be used as-is with the standard Light Sensor, other color sensors, or with other versions of the NXT software. For programs using the Light Sensor, see Using the Light Sensor.
