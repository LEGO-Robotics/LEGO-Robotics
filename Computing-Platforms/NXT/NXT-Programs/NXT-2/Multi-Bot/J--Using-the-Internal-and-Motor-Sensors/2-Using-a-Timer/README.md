# [Using a Timer](http://www.nxtprograms.com/NXT2/multi-bot/internal.html#Timer)

> The NXT-G programming system provides a few simple ways to do timing that are built into other blocks, such as the Wait block with Control set to Time, the Move block with Duration set to Seconds, and the duration of Sound Tone. However, these controls do not allow you to keep track of time while other blocks in the program are running. To measure time without pausing the program, you can use the Timer block.
