# [Using the Rotation Sensors](http://www.nxtprograms.com/NXT2/multi-bot/internal.html#Rotation)

> The NXT motors each have a built-in Rotation Sensor that can measure the rotation or angle change in a motor accurate to 1 degree and keep track of the total degrees turned since the program started or the last time the sensor was Reset. In addition to the simple uses of the Rotation Sensors built into the Motor and Move blocks (see the Driving Straight and Turning sections), you can also measure rotations independently in a program using the Rotation Sensor block.
