<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><ActivityCopyPaste fontsize="16" fontfamily="Verdana" xmlns="http://www.ni.com/ActivityRichTextDocument.xsd"><p>After you have built BOBB3E it is time for downloading the program to him.</p><p /><p>Connect BOBB3E to your computer and press the play icon in the program to the left.</p><p /><p>Your control BOBB3E with the remote control using channel 1.</p><p /><p>To get BOBB3E to lift things you need to press both buttons on the left (the <font color="#0000FF"><b>blue</b></font> side) and to lower the forks you need to press both buttons on the right (the <font color="#FF0000"><b>red</b></font> side).</p><p /><p>After you have driven around with BOBB3E for some time you might want to have a look at the <font color="#337CBB"><u><a action="NavigateActivity-GoToNextSlide">program</a></u></font>.</p></ActivityCopyPaste>

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><ActivityCopyPaste fontsize="16" fontfamily="Verdana" xmlns="http://www.ni.com/ActivityRichTextDocument.xsd"><p>The program is quite simple, as it does two things:</p><p /><p>The main loop receives the commands from the remote control and converts them to actions, like turning or lifting.</p><p /><p>You might have discovered that when you reversed with BOBB3E he went BEEP - BEEP - BEEP... This sound comes from the <font color="#337CBB"><u><a action="GoToProgram:RevAlarm.ev3p">RevAlarm</a></u></font> block, that monitors BOBB3E&amp;#39;s movements and whenever he reverses the alarm sounds.</p><p /><p>Up for a <font color="#337CBB"><u><a action="NavigateActivity-GoToNextSlide">challenge</a></u></font>?</p></ActivityCopyPaste>

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><ActivityCopyPaste fontsize="12" fontfamily="Verdana" xmlns="http://www.ni.com/ActivityRichTextDocument.xsd"><p>Here are some challenges you can try to do in order to make BOBB3E better:</p><p /><p>•  Can you make BOBB3E say sounds when he is lifting/lowering his forks?</p><p /><p>•  BOBB3E does by default drive rather slow - try to see if you can make him go faster!</p><p /><p>•  You could utilise that the remote has 4 channels and use that as different gears. Say, for instance, that when using Channel 1 is the same as driving in 1st gear; very slow. Channel 2 could make him go a little faster and using channel 4 would make him go very fast!</p><p /><p>•  The remote control can also be used as a Beacon, which BOBB3E is able to detect and drive towards. Can you make him automatically find the Beacon and lift it, when BOBB3E comes close enough to it?</p></ActivityCopyPaste>
