# AA Robotics Team Session 2


## Monday 2021-09-06

Skip the standard WeDo lesson as team members are already familiar with WeDo.

Instead of designing and prototyping 2 new forms of transportation, decide to focus on improving (by motorizing) the existing cargo truck designed and built in Session 1.

Go through the Engineering Design Process:

- __Explore__: design enhancements to motorize the cargo truck, with the WeDo Hub controlling the Motor which is in turn connected to the Wheels through a rubber band

- __Create__: build the motorizing components for the cargo truck, and code the program to make the truck go forward

- __Test__: make the truck go forward by running the program
  - _realize that the rubber band is not long enough to connect the motor to the further wheels_
  - _decide to improve the design by connecting the motor to the nearer wheels instead_
  - _test again_

- __Share__: done in video below

Core values covered in this session:
- Teamwork

Take a video to summarize about Discovery, Teamwork and other output up to Session 2:

- __Team Intro__ (by @AntoniLuongPham): 
  - AA Robotics team: brother Antoni & sister Ariana
  - From Belmont, CA

- __Discovery__ (by @ArianaLuongPham): what cargo is transported to & from our homes:
  - Receive:
    - toys
    - food
    - clothes
    - water
    - mail
    - packages
    - vaccines
  - Send:
    - trash
    - water
    - mail
    - food
  
- __Teamwork__ (by @AntoniLuongPham): work together to:
  - design
  - build
  - test and improve the Truck
  - also build a lot of tiny houses!

- __Truck Design 1/2__ (by @ArianaLuongPham):
  - big: spacious cargo hull with door
  - colorful:  with many colors: white, blue, yellow

- __Truck Design 2/2__ (by @AntoniLuongPham): motorizing the truck with:
  - WeDo Hub
  - motor
  - pulley
  - wheel

- __Test and Change__ (by @AntoniLuongPham):
  - test and observe that connecting the motor with the back wheels is not feasible because the rubber band is too short
  - change to connecting the motor with the front wheels instead

- __Code__ (by @ArianaLuongPham):
  - show WeDo code:
    - play a truck sound
    - make the truck go forward
    - make the truck go backward
  - run the code and show how it works

- __Demo__ (by @AntoniLuongPham):
  - show the Truck working on the Cargo Connect mat
