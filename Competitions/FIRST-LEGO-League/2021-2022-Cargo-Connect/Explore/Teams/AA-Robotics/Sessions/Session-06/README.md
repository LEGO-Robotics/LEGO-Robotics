# AA Robotics Team Session 6


## Saturday 2021-09-18


Design new forms of transportation for delivering cargo by Air & over Water.

Record a video of packages being sorted by the Sorting Center, then delivered by the airplane & the ship to 4 destinations.


(Skipped: Design features to adapt to Hot & Icy climate conditions.)


Implement safety feature for Sorting Center:
- Flashing Light & Beeping Sound during sorting

Discuss how a Safety Specialist would perform a safety check on the Sorting Center:
- Make a 'beep beep' sound to make sure no one puts their hands in the sorting area
- Make a flashing light to make sure it is the right package
- They need to have a sensor to check if the packege is in the sorting area


## Sunday 2021-09-19


Add Motion Sensor to Sorting Center to detect if there is a package to sort.
Record a video to demo this new capability.
