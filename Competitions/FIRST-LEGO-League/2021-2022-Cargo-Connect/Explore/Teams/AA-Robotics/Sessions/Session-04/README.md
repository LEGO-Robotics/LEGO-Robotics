Build & test Milo the Science Rover:
- Make it go forward & backward


Connect Milo the Science Rover to a cargo container, and make Milo pull the container to transport the cargo.

Discussion: how is cargo transported?
- trucks
- trains
- airplanes
- boats / ships
- drones

Discussion: how does the Freight Driver know what routes to take when transporting cargo?

Record a video of Milo transporting cargo from & to the Sorting Center on the mat.
- identify the route Milo can take on the Cargo Connect mat
- make Milo go to the Sorting Center
- load cargo into the Sorting Center
- crank left/right to sort
- unload cargo from the Sorting Center
- make Milo go to from Sorting Center to the homes


Core values covered in this session:
- Innovation: combining an existing robot (Milo) and an existing cargo container to create a transportation solution
