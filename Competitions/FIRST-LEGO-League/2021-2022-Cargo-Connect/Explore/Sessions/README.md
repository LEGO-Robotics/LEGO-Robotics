# Team Sessions


## Introduction to FIRST® LEGO® League Explore

In FIRST® LEGO® League Explore, teams focus on the fundamentals of __engineering__ as they explore __real-world problems__, learn to __design__ and __code__, and create unique solutions made with LEGO bricks and powered by LEGO Education WeDo 2.0 and SPIKE™ Essential.

FIRST LEGO League Explore is one of __three divisions by age group__ of the FIRST LEGO League program. This program inspires young people to __experiment__ and
grow their __confidence__, __critical thinking__, and __design__ skills through
__hands-on STEM learning__. FIRST LEGO League was created through an alliance between FIRST® and LEGO® Education.


### Welcome to CARGO CONNECT

Welcome to the FIRST® FORWARD season. This year’s FIRST LEGO League Explore
Challenge is called CARGO CONNECTSM. Children will learn about how cargo is __transported__, __sorted__, and __delivered__ to its destinations. As more demands are placed on transportation systems, children need to rethink how cargo is transported from place to place. We have the power to build a path forward and invent the future of transportation. And it starts here, with you.

During each session, they will experience the __engineering design process__. There is no set order for this process, and they may go through each part several times in a single session. This means that during a session, children will be __exploring the theme and ideas__, __creating solutions__, __testing__ them __iterating__ and __changing__ them, and then __sharing__ what they’ve learned with others.


__Engineering Design Process__
- __Explore__
- __Create__
- __Test__, and iteratively change/improve
- __Share__


### Working in Teams

Children work together in __teams of (up to) six__ using pieces from the LEGO® Education WeDo 2.0 or SPIKE™ Essential set, and a CARGO CONNECT Explore set. They will __collaborate__ and __communicate__ to __build__, __learn__, and __play__ together.

Children should be encouraged in every session to __work with their teammates__, __listen__ to each other, __take turns__, and __share__ ideas and pieces.


## Team Roles

Everyone on the team could experience each role multiple times throughout their FIRST® LEGO® League Explore experience. Using roles helps the team function more efficiently and ensures that everyone on the team is engaged. Some roles will be filled by multiple children during a session. For example, the builder and coder roles can be duplicated where the experience is designed for a pair of children.

- __Facilitator__: Guides the team through the session and their learning to achieve session outcomes.

- __Journey Recorder__: Captures the team's journey by taking pictures or video. This media can be used for the team poster.

- __Team Captain__: Shares team progress with Facilitator. Ensures session tasks are completed.

- __LEGO Element Finder__: Locates the specific LEGO elements needed for each build step.

- __Material Manager__: Gathers materials needed for the session and returns materials at end of session.

- __Builder__: Assembles the LEGO builds following the building instructions.

- __Coder__: Operates the device and creates the programs in the app.


## Playful Learning in Action

### FIRST Core Values

The FIRST® Core Values are the cornerstones of the program. They are among the fundamental elements of FIRST LEGO® League. By embracing the Core Values, children use __discovery__ and __exploration__ of the theme in each session and learn that __helping one another is the foundation of teamwork__. It is important that the children have __fun__. The more __playful__ the sessions are, the more __motivated__ the children will be.

- __Teamwork__: We found we were stronger when we worked together
- __Inclusion__: We respected each other and embraced our differences
- __Innovation__: We used creative and persistence to solve problems
- __Fun__: We enjoyed and celebrated what we did!
- __Discovery__: We explored new skills and ideas
- __Impact__: We applied what we learned to improve our world


## What Does the Team Need?


### LEGO® Education Set

LEGO®Education WeDo 2.0 Set

OR

LEGO® Education SPIKE™ Essential Set


### Electronic Device

Your team will need a compatible Bluetooth-enabled device like a laptop, tablet, or computer. To view system requirements and download software, visit legoeducation.com/downloads.


### Team Poster Supplies

Each team will need a large poster board and various art supplies and materials in Sessions 10-11.


### CARGO CONNECT Explore Set

Each team will get one CARGO CONNECT Explore Set. Leave the LEGO® elements in their plastic bags until the sessions in which they are needed. Two printed books contain the building instructions for the Explore model.


### Tips

- The prototyping pieces are used throughout the sessions to build solutions to the design challenges.

- There are baseplates provided. These can be used for each individual student to create his or her own build ideas or can be combined to create their team model.


## General Management Tips


### FACILITATOR TIPS

- Determine your timeline. How often will you meet and for how long? How many meetings will you have before your festival?

- Set team guidelines, procedures,and behaviors for your meetings.

- Get into the mindset that the team should be doing most of the work and learning. You are there to facilitate their journey and remove any major obstacles.

- Lead your team through the Introduction and Share activities provided in each session.

- Use the guiding questions in the sessions to provide focus and direction on what the team will do.

- Jobs are listed in some sessions that connect to the Career Connections pages in the back of the Engineering Notebook. Additional enrichment activities are also provided on these pages.


### MATERIAL MANAGEMENT

- Place any extra or found LEGO® pieces in a cup.

- Have the children who are missing pieces come to the cup to look for them.

- Wait to dismiss your team until you look over their LEGO set.

- The lid of the LEGO set can be used as a tray to keep pieces from rolling away.

- Use plastic bags or containers to store any unfinished builds and their associated pieces or assembled models.

- Designate a storage space for the built models, Explore set, and LEGO container.

- The role of the Material Manager is to help in the process of clearing away and storing materials.


### ENGINEERING NOTEBOOK TIPS

- Read the Engineering Notebook carefully. Each team member should have one.

- It contains all the information the team needs, and it guides them through the sessions.

- The tips in this Team Meeting Guide will direct you how to support each session.

- As facilitator, help guide the team members in the performance of their roles during each session.

- The sessions contain individual and team tasks to help the team perform their roles independently.
