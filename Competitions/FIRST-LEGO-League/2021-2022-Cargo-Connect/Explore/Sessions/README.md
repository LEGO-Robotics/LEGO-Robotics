# Team Sessions


## Introduction to FIRST® LEGO® League Explore

In FIRST® LEGO® League Explore, teams focus on the fundamentals of __engineering__ as they explore __real-world problems__, learn to __design__ and __code__, and create unique solutions made with LEGO bricks and powered by LEGO Education WeDo 2.0 and SPIKE™ Essential.

FIRST LEGO League Explore is one of __three divisions by age group__ of the FIRST LEGO League program. This program inspires young people to __experiment__ and
grow their __confidence__, __critical thinking__, and __design__ skills through
__hands-on STEM learning__. FIRST LEGO League was created through an alliance between FIRST® and LEGO® Education.


### Welcome to CARGO CONNECT

Welcome to the FIRST® FORWARD season. This year’s FIRST LEGO League Explore
Challenge is called CARGO CONNECTSM. Children will learn about how cargo is __transported__, __sorted__, and __delivered__ to its destinations. As more demands are placed on transportation systems, children need to rethink how cargo is transported from place to place. We have the power to build a path forward and invent the future of transportation. And it starts here, with you.

During each session, they will experience the __engineering design process__. There is no set order for this process, and they may go through each part several times in a single session. This means that during a session, children will be __exploring the theme and ideas__, __creating solutions__, __testing__ them __iterating__ and __changing__ them, and then __sharing__ what they’ve learned with others.


__Engineering Design Process__
- __Explore__
- __Create__
- __Test__, and iteratively change/improve
- __Share__


### Working in Teams

Children work together in __teams of (up to) six__ using pieces from the LEGO® Education WeDo 2.0 or SPIKE™ Essential set, and a CARGO CONNECT Explore set. They will __collaborate__ and __communicate__ to __build__, __learn__, and __play__ together.

Children should be encouraged in every session to __work with their teammates__, __listen__ to each other, __take turns__, and __share__ ideas and pieces.


## Team Roles

Everyone on the team could experience each role multiple times throughout their FIRST® LEGO® League Explore experience. Using roles helps the team function more efficiently and ensures that everyone on the team is engaged. Some roles will be filled by multiple children during a session. For example, the builder and coder roles can be duplicated where the experience is designed for a pair of children.

- __Facilitator__: Guides the team through the session and their learning to achieve session outcomes.

- __Journey Recorder__: Captures the team's journey by taking pictures or video. This media can be used for the team poster.

- __Team Captain__: Shares team progress with Facilitator. Ensures session tasks are completed.

- __LEGO Element Finder__: Locates the specific LEGO elements needed for each build step.

- __Material Manager__: Gathers materials needed for the session and returns materials at end of session.

- __Builder__: Assembles the LEGO builds following the building instructions.

- __Coder__: Operates the device and creates the programs in the app.


## Playful Learning in Action

### FIRST Core Values

The FIRST® Core Values are the cornerstones of the program. They are among the fundamental elements of FIRST LEGO® League. By embracing the Core Values, children use __discovery__ and __exploration__ of the theme in each session and learn that __helping one another is the foundation of teamwork__. It is important that the children have __fun__. The more __playful__ the sessions are, the more __motivated__ the children will be.

- __Teamwork__: We found we were stronger when we worked together
- __Inclusion__: We respected each other and embraced our differences
- __Innovation__: We used creative and persistence to solve problems
- __Fun__: We enjoyed and celebrated what we did!
- __Discovery__: We explored new skills and ideas
- __Impact__: We applied what we learned to improve our world


## What Does the Team Need?


### LEGO® Education Set

LEGO®Education WeDo 2.0 Set

OR

LEGO® Education SPIKE™ Essential Set


### Electronic Device

Your team will need a compatible Bluetooth-enabled device like a laptop, tablet, or computer. To view system requirements and download software, visit legoeducation.com/downloads.


### Team Poster Supplies

Each team will need a large poster board and various art supplies and materials in Sessions 10-11.


### CARGO CONNECT Explore Set

Each team will get one CARGO CONNECT Explore Set. Leave the LEGO® elements in their plastic bags until the sessions in which they are needed. Two printed books contain the building instructions for the Explore model.


### Tips

- The prototyping pieces are used throughout the sessions to build solutions to the design challenges.

- There are baseplates provided. These can be used for each individual student to create his or her own build ideas or can be combined to create their team model.


## General Management Tips


### FACILITATOR TIPS

- Determine your timeline. How often will you meet and for how long? How many meetings will you have before your festival?

- Set team guidelines, procedures,and behaviors for your meetings.

- Get into the mindset that the team should be doing most of the work and learning. You are there to facilitate their journey and remove any major obstacles.

- Lead your team through the Introduction and Share activities provided in each session.

- Use the guiding questions in the sessions to provide focus and direction on what the team will do.

- Jobs are listed in some sessions that connect to the Career Connections pages in the back of the Engineering Notebook. Additional enrichment activities are also provided on these pages.


### MATERIAL MANAGEMENT

- Place any extra or found LEGO® pieces in a cup.

- Have the children who are missing pieces come to the cup to look for them.

- Wait to dismiss your team until you look over their LEGO set.

- The lid of the LEGO set can be used as a tray to keep pieces from rolling away.

- Use plastic bags or containers to store any unfinished builds and their associated pieces or assembled models.

- Designate a storage space for the built models, Explore set, and LEGO container.

- The role of the Material Manager is to help in the process of clearing away and storing materials.


### ENGINEERING NOTEBOOK TIPS

- Read the Engineering Notebook carefully. Each team member should have one.

- It contains all the information the team needs, and it guides them through the sessions.

- The tips in this Team Meeting Guide will direct you how to support each session.

- As facilitator, help guide the team members in the performance of their roles during each session.

- The sessions contain individual and team tasks to help the team perform their roles independently.


## Pre-Session Checkpoint

Please read the student Engineering Notebook and this Team Meeting Guide before starting the sessions. They are full of very useful information to guide you through the program.

Use this checkpoint to help you get started and guide you toward success.

- Make sure you have a Bluetooth-enabled device with the WeDo 2.0 or SPIKE™ Essential app installed.

- Unpack the WeDo 2.0 or SPIKE™ Essential set (if not already done) and sort the LEGO® elements into the tray.

- Make sure the hub is fully charged or has batteries in it.

- Familiarize yourself with the contents of the Explore set.

- Explore the FIRST® Core Values. These are the essential foundation for your team.

- Watch the FIRST LEGO League Explore Season video and other videos on the FIRST LEGO League You Tube channel.

- The team could complete the Introduction and some Getting Started activities in the app so that they gain experience in building and coding before starting the sessions.

- Discuss transportation-related vocabulary with the team. Words could include product, package, cargo, efficiency, access, safety, and connections.
